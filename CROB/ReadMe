This is the automaton for the game Iron Rage on Kongregate, it's a simple image search and clicking whenever appropriate
It's kinda set up for my computer tho, so I think if you want to use it for other computers, you need to set some of the paths correctly as well
also, this code is kinda old, I don't play the game anymore, so there might be some changes in the game as well

This code uses ImageSearch script that I found on an old YouTube video circa 2016, with the link attached.

Here are some links to how to make imagesearch work:

If you've done the setup, and changed the directories then it should work on your PC too.
